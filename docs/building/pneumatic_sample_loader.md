The pneumatic sample loader tool adapts the NIST Autonomous Formulations Laboratory sample loading system onto the Jubilee platform. This system adds the capability of transferring liquid samples prepared on the Jubilee platform to a flow cell sample container for measurement, for example with an x-ray scattering instrument. The science-jubilee 'tool' module of this system allows the NIST-AFL system and science-jubilee to co-exist and allows control of the AFL system from the science-jubilee control software. This NIST-AFL system is fully documented at the system's [repository](https://github.com/pozzo-research-group/AFL-sample-loader). See the build guide here for usage instructions.
