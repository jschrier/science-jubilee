# Default wiring guide

This is our recommended default wiring for new Jubilee builds. Start here unless you know you need something different.

**Not shown** -- attach the electronics back-panel assembly to your assembled frame, using fourteen M5 x 8mm to attach to the stamped T-nuts in the back of the frame. You may find it convenient to loosen or even remove the power switch. I

We assume that you are building the recommended Duet 3 Mini + 3 HC option.  [Instructions for other configurations can be found on the Jubilee3D website](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Assembly_Instructions#Electronics)

*Note:* The following diagram is correct, except the `ZL` and `ZB` wire labels are swapped (the wiring and board positions are correct, just the labels)

*Note:* A Science Jubilee builder who is not installing the heat bed can skip the instructions related to the Heated Bed and solid state relay.

*Note:* If your Filastruder kit came with a y-axis limit switch cable that is only 300 mm long (instead of the notional 450 mm), you can rotate the Duet 3 HC expansion board and get it to connect without straining the cable.
